ng = {name: "Negroni", description: "Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by a dauntless Italian count who demanded that the bartender replace the club soda in his Americano with gin. It was a substitution that launched a thousand riffs."}
co = {name: "Cosmopolitan", description: "The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show 'Sex and the City' was at its peak. The pink-hued Martini was a favorite of the characters on the show."}

Originally conceived as a hangover cure by the bar staff at Cairo's Shepherd's Hotel (before it burned to the ground in 1952), this bourbon- and gin-based drink has been around for 70 years."}
